# AirBnB-Price-Prediction-Models

A statistical model built to predict the price of an AirBnB given listing information (i.e. neighbourhood, apartment type, room characteristics, etc.) in 'NYC', 'LA', 'DC', 'Boston', 'SF', 'Chicago'.

This notebook contains examples running regression estimations on the AirBnB dataset. Our target variable is price($USD) of the listing.
